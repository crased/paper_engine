# ============================================
# Executable Filters Configuration
# ============================================
#
# This file allows you to add CUSTOM filters to exclude non-game executables.
# DEFAULT filters are always active and cannot be disabled (defined in functions.py).
#
# DEFAULT FILTERS (always active):
# - Substring: crash, uninstall, setup, config, launcher, update, installer, unity, unreal, helper, reporter
# - Position: unins*, setup*, install*, vcredist*, ue4prereq*, directx*
#
# Add your custom filters below. These will be combined with defaults.
#
# ============================================

[BLACKLIST]
# Format: filter_name = pattern
# Filters out any executable containing this substring (case-insensitive)
#
# Examples (uncomment to use):
# my_custom_filter = crash_handler
# another_filter = debug
# eac_filter = easyanticheat

[BLACKLIST_Position]
# Format: filter_name = pattern,start_position
# Filters out executables where pattern appears at specific position
# start_position: Character index (0-based) where pattern must start
#
# Examples (uncomment to use):
# filter_redist = redist,0      # Filters: redist_x64.exe, redist_x86.exe
# filter_dx = dx,0              # Filters: dx_setup.exe, dxwebsetup.exe
# filter_eac = eac_,0           # Filters: eac_launcher.exe, eac_setup.exe
#
# Common patterns:
# - unins* (uninstallers) - already in defaults
# - setup* (installers) - already in defaults
# - install* (installers) - already in defaults
