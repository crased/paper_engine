# Configuration file for prepare_local_dataset.py
# Paper Engine - Dataset preparation and label grouping settings

[Directories]
# Input/output directories
dataset_dir = dataset
screenshots_dir = screenshots
output_dir = dataset

[Dataset]
# Dataset split ratio (0.0 to 1.0)
train_split = 0.8
# Random seed for reproducible splits (set to 0 for random)
random_seed = 42

[LabelGrouping]
# Enable custom label grouping (true/false)
# If false, labels are auto-discovered and sorted alphabetically
enable_custom_grouping = false

# Label group names (comma-separated)
# Groups are assigned sequential class IDs in the order listed
# Format: group_name = label1, label2, label3
# Example for Cuphead:
#   enemies = enemy, boss, minion
#   projectiles = bullet, fireball, pink_object
#   items = coin, health, parry_object
#   player = cuphead, mugman
#   obstacles = platform, wall, hazard

# When enable_custom_grouping = true, only labels listed below will be included
# Unlisted labels found in annotations will be ignored with a warning

[Groups]
# Define your label groups below
# Each group gets sequential class IDs starting from 0
#
# Example configuration for Cuphead:
# player = cuphead, mugman
# enemies = enemy, boss, devil
# projectiles = bullet, fireball, pink_parry
# items = coin, health_pickup
# environment = platform, background_element
#
# This would create class IDs:
#   0: cuphead
#   1: mugman
#   2: enemy
#   3: boss
#   4: devil
#   5: bullet
#   6: fireball
#   7: pink_parry
#   8: coin
#   9: health_pickup
#   10: platform
#   11: background_element

# Add your groups here (uncomment and customize):
# player =
# enemies =
# projectiles =
# items =
# environment =

[LabelMapping]
# Optional: Rename labels during conversion
# Format: original_name = new_name
# This is applied before grouping
#
# Example:
# pink_object = parry_object
# health = health_pickup
# cuphead_player = cuphead
