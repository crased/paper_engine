#figure out direction i want to take this:
 

#game_bot:
 @get the game bot running
  finish writing opencv scripts
   ?loop through the screenshots and dataset
   ?compare the results find an algorithm for it
   ?figure out how to take data set and intergrate it into bot
   ?write function to see if images are a match maybe with the metadata?
   ?encapsulate dataset
 @finish this playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KecMlLUuiE4&list=PL1m2M8LQlzfKtkKq2lK5xko4X-8EZzFPI&index=7
#ui/ux:
 @write more interactive prints too skip through some scripts
  write a line to choose what game_exe you want to run it on
  maybe a selecter for how many screenshots
  lock screenshot script to game window
  rewrite {Yes/No} line so its counts down from 10 and then automatically defaults into running game first
# unrelated but revise/update resume
#also update and move some scripts outside of main.py in seperate function file
